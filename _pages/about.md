About Me
======

My work consists of creating decision-ready insights that improve financial accuracy, operational efficiency, and compliance in behavioral health organizations.

In my professional experience as a data analyst, I’ve been trusted to work with complex datasets related to financial audits, demographics, billing, and productivity metrics. I’ve supported decision-makers by turning raw data into actionable insights. I’ve seen firsthand how thorough analysis can improve operations, accuracy, and accountability. Being valued in these roles has reinforced my belief that my strength lies in connecting technical skills with clear narratives.

My journey into data science blends creativity and logic, though I wasn’t always focused on working with data. Growing up immersed in music playing cello and clarinet and I studied music at University of California, Santa Barbara. Despite picturing my career in orchestral performance as exciting and glamorous, I kept gravitating more towards technical skills. Mathematics and problem-solving have always been my strenght in school as I participated in robotic camps and math competitions. After graduation, a coding bootcamp and frontend development work rekindled my technical interests, where I continue to work on practical, meaningful solutions.

As an aspiring data scientist, I bring a well-rounded perspective shaped by both the arts and quantitative disciplines. I approach data with curiosity not just to find answers, but to understand the story behind the numbers and communicate it in a way that creates impact.
