About Me
======

I have several years of analytics and programming experience, from creating software projects for hackathons in the US, interning for startups for mental health, and extracting, transforming, and loading data using Excel, Python, and SQL. 

During my career in programming, I was assigned a project to create the landing page for Gaia Wearable, an app based platform to predict and detect client meltdowns and episodes. I had the opportunity to build with Typescript and connect the REST APIs with NodeJS to create the user log-in flow and data visualization as part of the landing page. 

In my most recent experience at Exodus Recovery, I took full ownership in the flagship program where I was the point of contact for all data related projects. The new program followed our migration from Access to cloud platforms (CareLogic and Pentaho), where I automated monthly demographic reports by writing SQL queries to extract data from complex pipelines.
