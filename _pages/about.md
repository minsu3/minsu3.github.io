Currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Science at Nottingham Trent University (2026), with prior experience as a data analyst focused on behavioral health analytics.

About Me
======

I focus on turning complex data into clear, decision-ready insights that improve financial accuracy, operational efficiency, and compliance in behavioral health organizations.

In my work as a data analyst, I’ve handled data related to financial audits, demographics, billing, and productivity metrics, helping leaders make informed decisions from complex, real-world data. These experiences have shown me the value of pairing solid analysis with clear communication to make insights actually useful.

My path into data science combines creativity and problem-solving. I studied both music and politics at UC Santa Barbara, but was always drawn to technical thinking through math, robotics, and coding. After graduating, a coding bootcamp and frontend development work helped me transition toward building practical, data-driven solutions.

Today, I approach data with curiosity—looking beyond the numbers to understand the story they tell and communicate insights that make an impact.
