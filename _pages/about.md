Currently studying a MSc in Data Science (September 2026) with prior experience in healthcare informatics and app development.

About Me
======

I am a data professional who enjoys turning data into insights to help people make better decisions. I’ve worked in healthcare, technology, and startups, helping teams understand their data and use it to improve operations and outcomes. 

Over the past 3 years, I supported daily operations and helped improve clinical outcomes for behavioral health organizations, successfully increasing continuity rates through data-driven reports and dashboards. Early in my career, I contributed to a startup building monitoring tools for individuals with autism, developing frontend applications and real-time data visualization.

As of now, I'm pursuing a Master's in Data Science to advance my technical skills and take ownership in deeper level projects. My path into data science combines creativity and problem-solving. I hold two BA's in Music and Political Science, but I was always drawn to technical work through constant involvement with math, robotics, and programming. After graduating undergrad, a coding bootcamp and frontend development internship helped me transition toward building my career as a data professional.

In my spare time, I try to squeeze in around 30 running miles into my [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/minsukim). I also play the cello (and occasionally perform). I like to keep my life balanced with music, physical activities, and deep work.
